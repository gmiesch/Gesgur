##gesgur
gesgur is a tool we created to help users navigate imgur's website with the use of a Myo Armband. We offer two versions of this tool, in one version there is no styling done on imgur's website and instead just a Myo Script is used to get the Myo functioning properly. Our more advanced version utilizes a Google Chrome extension that refortmats the layout of imgur's website to give the user a better experience when interacting using the Myo. 

##Downloads and Instructions 
We created a simple website that instructions on how to download our project, the commands that it recognizes, and a demo our the product being used. The website is: http://gesgur.azurewebsites.net/
